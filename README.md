# Mealplanner

Written while learning Django, the mealplanner is a handy tool for managing family meals.

It tracks past and future meals, and also suggests less recently used meals, to help keep things varied.



## Running locally

1. `cd` into the mealplanner root project
2. Activate your virtualenv with source mealplanner_venv/bin/Activate
3. Start the Django runserver with `python manage.py runserver`
